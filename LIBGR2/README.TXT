The code library for the PK8000 graphic video mode.

The variable MODE_CPM, in the CONFIG.I80 file, determines for which
platform the library is compiled - for CP/M, or for downloading
from a cassette recorder.

The result is saved in the PLMTOOL\LIB and PLMTOOL\INCLUDE folders,
where PLMTOOL is the folder with the PL/M-80 compiler. The location of
the PLMTOOL folder is set in the %PLM80% environment variable.
